                This list of sources will be helpful in me gathering tips on how to alter my application project idea. I want to build a simple but effective application. 
                I felt that the sources I wanted to focus on keep the information simple and easy to understand. I want to be able to implement and play with various ideas 
                to hone in on unique and useful features. Most of all I want to be able to say that I solved a real world problem with this application.
                <br><br>
                The sources I provide go over a variety Web Resources. I kept them general as I'm still unsure of what exactly I want to build at this time. 
                I'm planning on using these to get more information on how to use APIs within a project and make use of information sets that are already avilable to us. 
                As of now my project includes using an interactive webpage to show up-to-date data on fires and emergency calls in the area that a user inputs. This will 
                allow an easier way than searching the news or social media apps to figure out why a firetruck or emergency vehicles are being used around their area. To
                do this I figured that resources like Freecodecamp and W3 will help me to understand how to implement APIs and use them, but also how to search for them. I also 
                included some APIs that exist like Zippopotam. I included Google Maps Platform as I would like to provide a map for the users showing the location where 
                emergency vehicles are called.
